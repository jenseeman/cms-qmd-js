{: #CMS-Manifest-Guidance}

CMS dQMs use manifest capabilities to define terminology packages for a given cycle. CMS follows guidance in the manifest section of the [QM IG](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cqm/measure-conformance.html#manifest). Manifests used for CMS development SHALL conform to the [CRMI Manifest Library](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/crmi/STU1/StructureDefinition-crmi-manifestlibrary.html) profile.
