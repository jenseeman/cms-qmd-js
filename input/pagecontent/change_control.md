### Process
#### Initiating a change request
1. Create an issue in the [CMS QMD IG repository](https://github.com/cqframework/cms-qmd). 
* Include a brief description of the change as well as relevant details such as standards versions, applicable timelines or related ONC Jira issues. 


#### Impact Assessment
1. The CMS standards team will perform an initial review of the request. 

2. If needed, additional information may be requested through comments on the issue. 

3. The CMS standards team will evaluate feasibility, identify stakeholders and may develop proposed solutions.


#### Community Vetting & Approval
1. The CMS standards team will determine a plan for stakeholder vetting and approval through discussions on community calls or email.

2. The CMS standards team will document relevant discussions, including impacts, concerns, or timelines through comments on the Github issue.

3. Approval or rejection of a change request will be documented on the issue.
* Approved requests will include a planned date or version for implementation.
* Rejected requests will include rationale for rejection.


### Applying Updates
1. Approved changes will be applied to the IG build following the current Github Commit note practice of referencing the issue #/name in the atomic commit notes.

2. Pull requests (PRs) or commits within the repository will reference the original request.

3. Each implemented change will be described in the Changes section of the IG.

4. Updates will be reviewed by stakeholders in an IG build prior to publication.


### Versioning
1. Major versions will be triggered by updates to dependencies (e.g., QM IG, CRMI).

2. Minor versions will be triggered when guidance or non breaking changes are made.

3. Patch versions may be used for technical corrections, such as formatting or typographical errors.

 
### Publication
TBD


### Communication
1. The CMS standards team will communicate to stakeholders when a new version of the IG is available.
